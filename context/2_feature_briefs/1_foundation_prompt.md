## PROJECT BRIEF:

I want to build a simple chrome extension that will do 2 things only, but will do them ideally.
First thing - Alarm.
Second thing - Timer.

## FEATURES:

There won't be any authentication and there will be only one role - a user.
Below is the initial list of user stories.

1. As a user I'm able to click an extension button on my browser and see the tab opened with UI
2. There's two main sections in the menu: Alarm and Timer. Alarm is a default section
3. Alarm section. I'm able to:
    3.1 Create a new Alarm. Several Alarms can be created. All time is in 24-hour format (important: not in AM/PM!).
    3.2 Delete an existing Alarm
    3.3 Turn on or turn off existing Alarm
    3.4 See the list of all existing Alarms
    3.5 In the existing alarm i should see time when it's active and how much time is left to Alarm event.
    3.6 When I create a new Alarm:
        3.6.1 I can pick time. Date is always today. I can't pick the date.
        3.6.2 Default time is 1 hour more than current time. Max default time is 23:59
        3.6.3 I can add a label in 1-line text input
        3.6.4 I can save or go back without saving
    3.7. When Alarm went off:
        3.7.1 It's automatically deleted from the list
        3.7.2 The Alarm notification appears in the exact same tab with the text "Hey, it's [Alarm time]"
        3.7.3 There's one button "Thanks" that closes the tab and deletes the alarm
        3.7.4 There's no Alarm sounds, nothing is blinking. Just a message that it's the time.
        3.7.5 The Alarm notification doesn't close automatically, it's visible until I click the button
4. Timer section. I'm able to:
    4.1 Pick hours (00-23) and minutes (00-59), without seconds
    4.2 Click start and timer starts
    4.3 I can see how time goes off
    4.4 Even if I close the tab, the time continues going. I can open tab anytime and see the correct time that is left.
    4.5 I can click "That will do" and Timer stops and resets automatically. There's no pause button
    4.6 When Timer went off:
        4.6.1 The Timer notification appears in the exact same tab with the text "Hey, it's time - [time] has past"
        4.6.2 There's one button "Thanks" that closes the tab.
        4.6.3 There's no Alarm sounds, nothing is blinking. Just a message that it's the time.
        4.6.4 The Alarm notification doesn't close automatically, it's visible until I click the button.

## UI:
Please use the files in the [UI reference](../1_ui_reference) folder as the complete UI specification for this Chrome extension. These files contain:

**Design System & Styling:**
- Follow the exact terminal color scheme (green-on-black) from `index.css`
- Use the custom Tailwind configuration from `tailwind.config.ts` including terminal fonts, colors, and animations
- Import the terminal fonts (JetBrains Mono, Source Code Pro) as shown in `index.html`

**Layout & Components:**
- Replicate the exact layout structure from `TerminalApp.tsx`
- Maintain the ASCII art header, system uptime display, and terminal-style borders
- Keep the two-column grid layout for Alarms and Timers sections
- Preserve all animations: blinking indicators, scan-line effect, and terminal glow

Key Details:
- Max width: 500px (for Chrome extension popup)
- Font: monospace terminal fonts throughout
- Color scheme: HSL-based green terminal theme
- All interactive elements should match the terminal aesthetic

Do not deviate from this visual design - it should look exactly like the reference UI.
