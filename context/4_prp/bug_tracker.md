### Task

1. Look at the items below in the Bugfix section.
2. If the item is checked with both checkboxes, skip it.
3. If at least one of the item checkboxes isn't checked, please fix the item.
4. When you've done with fixing the stated bugs, please update this document - make the first checkbox checked. The second one is for me, if the bugfix passes the test and all is good.

### Bugfix

- [x] [x] 1. uptime on the top - we don't need it, please remove
- [x] [x] 2. date on the top - make it in the format DD/MM/YYYY. Also make it in one line with time
- [x] [x] 3. make the section ALARM & TIMER SYSTEM take a little less space in height, maybe remove 2 or 3 lines and make it still look good
- [x] [x] 4. make the deletion button twice as big
- [x] [x] 5. reduce all the margins a little bit and you may reduce font size a little bit, so that all the popup takes up less space in height (at least 50% less)
- [x] [x] 6. the alarms icon looks busted a bit, please check the markup
- [x] [x] 7. in timer and alarms notification tab increase the margin between the label and a button. they are too close to each other now
- [x] [x] 8. in timer and alarms notification tab make the content fully centered (vertically and horizontally). it should be centered on the page as well. it's still not centered on the page
- [x] [x] 9. now the alarms icon and timers are the same. alarms should differ
- [x] [x] 10. put error Please enter both time and label before the footer. UPD: it's still under the footer, you haven't fixed it.
- [x] [x] 11. even if the vertical scrollbar appears, we don't need to show it. we still should be able to scroll though.
