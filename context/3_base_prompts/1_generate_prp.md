## Task

1. Learn the file with Feature description: [foundation prompt](../2_feature_briefs/1_foundation_prompt.md)
2. Generate a complete Project Requirement Prompt (PRP) for feature implementation with thorough research.

## Research Process

1. Codebase Analysis
   - Search for similar features/patterns in the codebase
   - Identify files to reference in PRP
   - Note existing conventions to follow

2. External Research
   - Search for similar features/patterns online
   - Library documentation (include specific URLs)
   - Implementation examples (GitHub)
   - Best practices and common pitfalls

3. User Clarification (if relevant and needed)
   - Specific patterns to mirror and where to find them?
   - Integration requirements and where to find them?

## PRP Generation

1. After you completed with the Research Process, ultrathink and plan your approach on building a feature.
2. Create a new file `{feature-name}.md`. Use [prp template](../4_prp/prp_template.md) as template 
3. In this new file, write all the details on how to implement the feature following the template.

## Output
Save the new file in [prp](../4_prp) folder as `4_prp/{feature-name}.md`

## Quality Checklist
Score the PRP you created on a scale of 1-10 (confidence level to succeed in one-pass implementation) and write the score for me as a chat reply.
Remember, the goal is one-pass implementation success through comprehensive context.
